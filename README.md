# WeatherApp

This app gives you forecast of the weather
up to three days for your location or one entered by
the user in the search bar.

It shows you the general forecast for the day, including
info about sunrise and sunset, temperature, rain and
description of the weather using icons, all this thanks to
the weather API (https://www.weatherapi.com/)

Puts into practice the fetching API and async await concepts,
also DOM manipulation in a tabbe UI for the info, this is part
of TheOdinProject curriculum.
